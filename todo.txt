Most of the modern languages use lexical scoping.
This means that you can figure out which declaration a
variable name refers to just by reading the text of the program.

For example:

var a = "outer";
{
  var a = "inner";
  print a;
}

Here, we know that the "a" being printed is the variable
declared on the previous line, and not the global one.
Running the program doesn't —can't— affect this.
The scope rules are part of the static semantics of the
language, which is why they’re also called static scope.

A variable usage refers to the preceding
declaration with the same name in the
innermost scope that encloses the expression
where the variable is used.
